We use our audience’s language, adapting our words and examples to reflect their lives, their businesses, their challenges, and our shared experiences. In short, we aim to inflect our voice with the humanizing qualities of empathy and emotion.</p>
                            <p class="category__description">But we also know that our customers trust us to be the experts.  So our tone is confident and professional, conveying the knowledge and authority that helps them feel protected.</p>
